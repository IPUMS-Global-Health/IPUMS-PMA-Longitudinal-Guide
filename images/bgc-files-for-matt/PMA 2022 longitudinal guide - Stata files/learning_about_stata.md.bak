Resources to learn about Stata include [the company website](https://www.stata.com/), official [FAQs](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/), official [blog](https://blog.stata.com/), a vibrant [user forum](https://statalist.org/), official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVk4G4nEtBS4tLOyHqustDA) and the Stata website's own [list of resources]( https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/resources/learning-about-stata/).

[Stata Press]( https://www.stata-press.com/) publishes excellent books on how to use Stata.  Four that we recommend are:

- [A Gentle Introduction to Stata, Sixth Edition](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/gentle-introduction-to-stata/) by Alan C. Acock, ISBN: 978-1-59718-269-0.
- [The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata]( https://www.stata.com/bookstore/workflow-data-analysis-stata/) by J. Scott Long, ISBN: 978-1-59718-047-4.
- [A Visual Guide to Stata Graphics]( https://www.stata.com/bookstore/visual-guide-to-stata-graphics/) by Michael N. Mitchell, ISBN: 978-1-59718-365-9.
- [An Introduction to Stata Programming, Second Edition]( https://www.stata.com/bookstore/introduction-stata-programming/) by Christopher F. Baum, ISBN: 978-1-59718-150-1.

The [Stata documentation website](https://www.stata.com/features/documentation/) offers dedicated, detailed, and freely available reference manuals for each of the fields referenced in this document:
* [Survey Data Reference Manual](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/survey-data-reference-manual/) is 220 pages, ISBN: 978-1-59718-350-5. 
* [Longitudinal/Panel Data Reference Manual](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/longitudinal-panel-data-reference-manual/) is 632 pages, ISBN: 978-1-59718-354-3.

For help on a particular Stata command, simply type "help *command_name*" at the Stata command prompt.  A brief explanation will open in a Stata Viewer window along with a link to a more complete explanation in the extensive PDF documentation.  And, of course, a quick Google search will usually turn up helpful answers to Stata-related questions.

One excellent private resource is [The Stata Guide](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide) blog by [Asjad Naqvi](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/).  He shares clear explanations and code to make a variety of very handsome maps and graphics.  The posts reside behind a paywall.  You may read three of them for free per month, or pay a subscription fee to [medium.com](http://www.medium.com) for unlimited access to his writing (and that of many other authors).

Finally, for survey data analysis, we heartily recommend the text [Applied Survey Data Analysis (2ed)](https://www.routledge.com/Applied-Survey-Data-Analysis/Heeringa-West-Berglund/p/book/9780367736118) by Heeringa, West, and Berglund, ISBN: 978-0-36773-611-8.  It is a treasure trove of thoughtful insight and its [companion website](https://websites.umich.edu/~surveymethod/asda/) shares datasets, code examples, and other resources for conducting analyses using a variety of software packages -- including both Stata and R.
